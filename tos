As a software development company, TrustPad has no role in enforcing KYC by default, however, we do provide such tools for fundraising entities using TrustPad to enforce on their users, if the entities choose to do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on TrustPad by fundraising entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said entities. TrustPad is implementing KYC tools into our launchpad through<!-- --> <a href="https://kycaid.com/">KYCAid</a>.

Although TrustPad makes no warranty as to the merit, legality, or juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable Securities Laws), token sale or fundraiser on top of TrustPad, we nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require KYC/AML on their token sale participants.</p><p>5.3.

Then, also take a photo of yourself (selfie of your face) holding your ID document and the paper you wrote on next to your face (not covering your face).</li><li>To share the submitted KYC information and documentation to the third parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information, and the end user (you) agree to this by using the Service;</li><li>To reject the use of the Service that TrustPad has the reasonable ground to believe that they are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities or any investigation when and if necessary upon the valid request by the court order.</li></ul><p>5.6. TrustPad expressly prohibits and rejects the use of the Service for any form of illicit activity, including money laundering, terrorist financing or trade sanctions violations, consistent with various jurisdictions’ laws, regulations and norms.
